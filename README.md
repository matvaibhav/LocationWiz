# LocationWiz
An Android App to learn your daily schedule and suggest friends based on your schedule. Developed as part of the course CSE 570: Wireless and Mobile Networking.

In today’s fast paced world, everybody is in a rush and we frequently forget to be at certain places at
designated times. It would be fantastic if someone provides us a reminder when we need to start travelling
to reach the location of our next appointment without explicitly writing down our schedule! The Location
Wiz does exactly this with minimum input from a user. The Schedule feature of Location Wiz keeps track
of all places you visit daily and after collecting sufficient data, it constructs a weekly schedule for you,
showing the locations you tend to be at every half an hour during a day of the week. Based on this
schedule, the sends you push notifications whenever an anomaly is detected between your current
location and what your schedule says. It also notifies you when it is time to travel to a certain location but
you are stationary.
Another exciting feature of Location Wiz App is Friend Suggestions. Generally, individuals who are
present at same locations at the same times have similar lifestyles and interests. Would it not be an
absolute pleasure to make acquaintance with people who have congruent schedules as yours? The
likelihood of such people developing great understanding and friendship is very high. The Location Wiz
Server looks for such congruence in different people’s trajectory in terms of both time and space. The
Location Wiz Server constructs a score for every possible pair of users and sends friend suggestions to the
user based on the score.
